Knowing how to finish a task is as important as knowing how to complete it as fast as possible and without lowering the quality of the final results.


### Simple steps

* Learn to type faster by completing a typing tutorial. The faster you can put your ideas in text/code, the faster you can get things done.

* Ifa task takes no more than 2 minutes of your time, then you can start right away.
* Once you get focused on completing a task take every measure to not be disturbed by external factors. Try using music with white noise. Using white noise may need some getting use to, but once you have the external noise distractions will be lower.
